## Why Use the OOP 
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and manage code.

-OOP is used for its ability to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by encapsulating data, enabling inheritance, and promoting abstraction

```javascript
// Creating an object
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.firstName);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, John

```

- Constructor Function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new , this)


## 4 Pillars 

- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
